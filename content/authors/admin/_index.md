I am a final year PhD student in EECS at MIT. <b>I am currently applying for faculty positions in Statistics and Computer Science (as of Fall 2023)</b>. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Caroline Uhler](https://www.carolineuhler.com) and [David Sontag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/).

My long-term research is focused on rigorously applying machine learning and AI to accelerate scientific discovery, and to make robust predictions about the effects of interventions in complex systems. 
This involves developing methodology for <b><i>causal structure learning</i></b>, <b><i>experimental design</i></b>, and <b><i>identifiable representation learning</i></b>.
I ground my work by applying these methods to problems in cellular biology, such as predicting the effects of drugs in different types of cancer cells.

I really enjoy teaching, mentoring, and organizing academic initiatives.
Check out the [lecture notes](https://github.com/csquires/6.S091-causality) and [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiyH4sDpByicWHWv-xaI4gRbxrpFv2-FA) for the causality class that I developed for MIT's 2023 January term, and check out the talk series on [Causality, Abstraction, Reasoning, and Extrapolation (CARE)](https://portal.valencelabs.com/care) that I am currently co-organizing. 

I'm a strong believer in the value of effective communication skills, serving as a coach in the [EECS Communication Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/).
Hopefully some of what I've learned from this experience is reflected in my [slides](https://github.com/csquires/chandler-squires-talks/blob/main/README.md) and [posters](https://github.com/csquires/chandler-squires-posters).

Finally, I like writing good, easy-to-use code (when time permits &#128517;), and I am the main developer of [causaldag](https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag), a Python package for creating, manipulating, and learning causal graphical models.
Shoot me an email to chat about the package or my work!
