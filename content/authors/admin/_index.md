My research is centered on learning the effects of intervening in complex systems, with a particular focus on cellular biology and healthcare. This spans causal structure learning, active learning for causal structure discovery, and multimodal data integration. I am lucky enough to be co-advised by Caroline Uhler and David Sontag.
