I am a final year PhD student in EECS at MIT. I am currently applying for faculty positions (Fall 2023). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Caroline Uhler](https://www.carolineuhler.com) and [David Sontag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/).

My long-term research is focused on rigorously applying machine learning and AI to accelerate scientific discovery, and to make robust predictions for interventions in complex systems. 
This involves developing methodology for <b><i>causal structure learning</i></b>, <b><i>experimental design</i></b>, and <b><i>identifiable representation learning</i></b>.
In my PhD, I have focused on applying these methods in the context of cellular biology.

I'm a strong believer in the value of effective communication skills, and I'm a fellow in the [EECS Communication Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/).
Here are links to my [slides](https://github.com/csquires/chandler-squires-talks/blob/main/README.md) and [posters](https://github.com/csquires/chandler-squires-posters). 

I take a lot of pride in mentoring and teaching, lecture notes and recordings from my 2023 course on causality can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiyH4sDpByicWHWv-xaI4gRbxrpFv2-FA).

I am the main developer of [causaldag](https://github.com/uhlerlab/causaldag), a Python package for creating, manipulating, and learning causal graphical models.
